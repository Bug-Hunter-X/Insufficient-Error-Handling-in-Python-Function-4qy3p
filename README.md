# Python Function with Insufficient Error Handling

This example demonstrates a Python function with limited error handling. The function aims to access a key within a dictionary and perform an operation. However, it only accounts for `KeyError` exceptions and omits handling other potential errors that could arise, such as `TypeError` if `data` is not a dictionary or `AttributeError` if `data` is None.  The improved solution addresses this by providing more comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and unexpected results.
